# Data Mesh and Self Service within Snowflake

A data mesh requires the creation of isolated areas that independent teams can manage/develop in Snowflake.

This repository makes a couple of assumptions and generate the required SQL to create an isolated/sandbox area.

- [Create the sandbox with schema, warehouse, roles](./create_sandbox.md).
- [Producer sharing data](./share_producer.md).
- [Consumer using shared data](./share_consumer.md).
